//! quik: CuaCode's terminal frontend, built to the Figma page 2 design.
//!
//! One screen: three lines of header, the conversation, the turn's own readout,
//! and an input field between two rules. The conversation is the same
//! `cuacode::session` and `cuacode::transcript` the app reads, so there is one
//! model of what a conversation is and two drawings of it.
//!
//!   quik                       talk to the worker
//!   quik <message>             open the conversation with it, sent the
//!                                moment the worker is up
//!   quik prompt.txt            the same, with the message read from a file:
//!                                one argument that names one is its contents
//!   quik --resume [id]         carry on with an earlier conversation: ask
//!                                which one, or take the one named. Escape at
//!                                that question starts a new conversation
//!                                instead (--continue and -r are the same flag)
//!   quik --fixture f.jsonl     replay a recorded stream, no worker at all
//!   quik --print --fixture f   fold a stream and print it, no terminal
//!   quik --version             the build id alone: <commits>.<short sha>
//!
//! The header carries that id, and one line under it in yellow when the remote
//! has commits this tree does not. `cuacode doctor` is where the whole answer
//! lives, including the upgrade.
//!
//! The terminal's own background is set to the design's page, so the screen is
//! the design's colour rather than whatever the profile happens to use.
